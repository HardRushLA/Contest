    <h1>HardRush DJ Competition</h1>
    <p>
        Since the pandemic, the LA underground has exploded with amazing new talent along with the DJs that kept us going during lockdown via Twitch and other virtual platforms. We at HardRush have had difficulties keeping track of every amazing up and coming DJ from in and around Southern California. Looking to broaden our horizons and diversify our lineups, HardRush is having a competition open to all SoCal HardDance DJs for a time slot at the next HardRush. This edition of HardRush will take place on August 19th, 2023, in LA.

Our expert panel will carefully evaluate all submissions and select the top 5 entrants, who will not only enjoy complimentary admission to HardRush but also advance to the next phase of the contest on our YouTube channel starting July 1st.
