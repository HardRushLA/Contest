    <h1>HardRush DJ Competition</h1>
    <p>
        As the years have gone by, we at HardRush have had difficulties keeping up with all the amazing up-and-coming DJs in and around Southern California. Looking to broaden our horizons and diversify our lineups, HardRush is holding a competition open to all SoCal HardDance DJs for a time slot at the next HardRush. This edition of HardRush will take place on August 19th, 2023 in LA.
    </p>
    <p>
        To enter, please submit a 10-15 minute video of you DJing to the link below no later than 11:59 PM on June 9th. HardRush will review all submissions and choose our top 5 videos; each of the top 5 entrants will receive free admission to HardRush. The chosen videos will then be uploaded to our YouTube channel on July 1st. The DJ whose video receives the most likes on YouTube by 11:59 PM on July 31st will be given a time slot at HardRush, and it will not be an opening or closing slot.
